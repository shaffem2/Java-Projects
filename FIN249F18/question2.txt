Question 2:
In my implementation of question one, I used an interface in order to achieve polymorphism with certain methods.
I also used some smaller features such as the "this" pointer and HashMaps.I also created several 
objects to model each individual part of the implementation, with the objects communicating with each other.
Java allowed me to take this object-oriented approach to the problem. By implementing in Java, it is
easy to understand the model and keep all the pieces moving together. Implementing this in a non-object-oriented 
manner would be a nightmare if it is even possible at all.
